Getting started
===============

Basic usage
-----------

The command interface is hopefully quite intuitive.  The following is a sample
session:

.. code-block:: sh

    ▶ rdial start my_task
    ▶ rdial running
    Currently running my_task since 2012-06-29T22:35:43Z
    ▶ rdial stop -m'Fixed bug #40'
    Task my_task running for 0:44:00.793449

Help on individual subcommands is available via ``rdial <subcommand> --help`` or
in the :doc:`usage` document.
