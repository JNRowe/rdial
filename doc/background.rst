Background
==========

I spend an awful lot of time sitting in front of a computer, working on a huge
number of disparate projects.  And when it comes time to gauge what I've been
working it would be nice if I could just fire up a simple tool to see the amount
of time I'm spending on various tasks and projects.

The features *I* need in a time tracking tool are:

* Easily accessible data, in a format that can be processed simply
* Ability to work off-line, because those times are considerably more common
  than some people seem to think
* Works on all the platforms I regularly use; desktop, mobile phone, ZipIt, and
  more

Now :mod:`rdial` is born, and I should be able to realise those dreams!
