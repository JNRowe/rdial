Why must I specify :option:`--new` when creating a new task
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Perhaps you're super special and never produce a typo, I'm not.  The
:option:`--new` option to :command:`rdial start` is a fix for this common -- to
me -- problem.

The :command:`rdial switch` command is of related design.  You can not use it
when no task is running, and attempting to do so is probably a sign you've lost
track of your state.  I consider this to be a massive problem, and would rather
not sidestep it by allowing :command:`rdial start` to stop running tasks or
:command:`rdial switch` to work without a running task.

Where does the name :program:`rdial` come from?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Around the beginning of 2012 I wrote a very simple shell script to track my
time, and at some point I decided it should be safer and cleaner.  I came up
with a very clever and imaginative name for this new project, and then promptly
forgot how it came about.

Since then I haven't even managed to come up with a clever backronym for it.

How do I process files using ``go``
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If you keep receiving ``ErrTrailingComma`` errors when reading files using
golang it is because you are processing files with empty message fields.  The
default behaviour of the ``encoding/csv`` pkg is to raise an error when it
encounters an empty final field.  You can tell ``go`` to accept empty final
fields by setting the ``TrailingComma`` attribute on your CSV reader.

.. sourcecode:: go

    reader := csv.NewReader(file)
    reader.TrailingComma = true
