rdial - Simple time tracking for simple people
==============================================

|status| |travis| |coveralls| |pypi| |pyvers| |readthedocs| |develop|

``rdial`` is a simple way to track the time you spend on tasks.  It tracks the
name of a task, its start time, its duration and optionally a message… nothing
more.

``rdial`` is released under the `GPL v3`_ license.

Requirements
------------

``rdial``’s mandatory dependencies outside of the standard library are:

* click_ ≥ 7.0
* jnrbase_ ``[colour,iso_8601]`` ≥ 1.0.0
* tabulate_

It should work with Python_ version 3.6, or newer.  If ``rdial`` doesn’t work
with the version of Python you have installed, file an issue_ and I’ll
endeavour to fix it.

The package has been tested on many UNIX-like systems, including Linux and OS
X, but it may work fine on other systems too.

To run the tests you’ll need pytest_.  Once you have pytest_ installed you can
run the tests with the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pytest tests

Database
--------

The database is just a directory of simple CSV files, making it useful to use
and abuse in other applications.  A sample database could be a file named
``task.csv`` with the following contents::

    start,delta,message
    2011-05-04T08:00:00Z,PT01H00M00S,working on issue 4
    2011-05-04T09:30:00Z,,

and a ``task2.csv`` file with the following contents::

    start,delta,message
    2011-05-04T09:15:00Z,PT00H15M00S,

The CSV files contain the following fields:

1. Start time expressed in UTC
2. Task duration
3. An optional message associated with the event

The start time and duration fields are given as `ISO 8601`_ formatted strings.

If a line does not contain a duration entry, then the task is considered to be
running.

Interface
---------

.. code-block:: console

    $ rdial start <task_name>
    $ rdial stop
    $ rdial report
    +-------+----------------+
    | task  | time           |
    +-------+----------------+
    | task  |        1:00:00 |
    | task2 | 1 day, 0:15:00 |
    +-------+----------------+
