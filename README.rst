``rdial`` is a simple way to track the time you spend on tasks.  It tracks the
name of a task, its start time and its durationâ€¦ nothing more.

``rdial`` is released under the `GPL v3`_ license.

Requirements
------------

``rdial``'s dependencies outside of the standard library are:

* aaargh_
* blessings_
* prettytable_

It should work with any version of Python_ 2.6 or newer.  If ``rdial`` doesn't
work with the version of Python you have installed, file an issue_ and I'll
endeavour to fix it.

The module has been tested on many UNIX-like systems, including Linux and OS X,
but it should work fine on other systems too.

To run the tests you'll need nose2_.  Once you have nose2_ installed you can run
the tests with the following commands::

    $ nose2 -v tests

Database
--------

The database is just a directory of simple text files, making it very easy to
use and abuse in other applications.  A sample database could be a file named
``task.csv`` with the following contents::

    start,delta,message
    2011-05-04T08:00:00Z,PT01H00M00S,working on issue 4
    2011-05-04T09:30:00Z,,

and a ``task2.csv`` file with the following contents::

    start,delta,message
    2011-05-04T09:15:00Z,PT00H15M00S

The format is a CSV file containing the following fields:

1. Start time expressed in UTC
2. Task duration
3. Message associated with the event

The start time and duration fields are given as ISO-8601 formatted strings.

If a line does not contain a duration entry then the task is considered to be
currently running.

Interface
---------

::

    $ rdial start <task_name>
    $ rdial stop
    $ rdial report
    +-------+----------------+
    | task  | time           |
    +-------+----------------+
    | task  |        1:00:00 |
    | task2 | 1 day, 0:15:00 |
    +-------+----------------+
